## ðŸ§© Introduction
This document describes the design and structure of the **Discrete Event Simulation Project**.  
It outlines the architecture, major components, and how events are processed within the system.

## ðŸ§­ Class Diagram
The following diagram illustrates the relationships between main components:

## ðŸ’¡ Design Decisions
Some of the key design choices include:
- Using **object-oriented principles** to encapsulate simulation logic.  
- Employing **discrete event scheduling** to model time-based behavior accurately.  
- Ensuring **modular structure** to allow future expansion or replacement of distribution models.  
- Supporting **different runtime modes** (slow, fast with messages, fast silent).
